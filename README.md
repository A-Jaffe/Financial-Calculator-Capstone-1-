# Financial Calculator
## Project Description
This is program, written in python, provides a user the option of two 
financial calculators. Either to calculate a return on an **investment** or 
the monthly repayment of a **bond**. It is the first Capstone project
required in the Hyperion Development Software Engineer bootcamp.

## Functionality
First, the user can choose between an investment or bond calculation.

If the user decides on the **investment calculator**, they will be prompted
for the amounut of money they wish to invest, the interest rate of the investment
and the amount of years they will be investing for. Next they are asked if they would
like to calculate compound or simple interest.
Finally the initial amount, interest rate, type of interest and the result is displayed to the user.

If the user decides on the **bond calculator**, they are prompted for the present value of the bond, the interest rate of the bond and the number of months they will be paying over.
Finally the present value, interest rate, number of months and the monthly repayment amount will be displayed.
